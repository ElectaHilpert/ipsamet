This directory will always contain the abi as originally deployed, under the solc version with which it was deployed. You can check which version it was deployed with under meta/

We may also maintain versions recreated with later versions of solc for compatibility for later projects.

RealityETH.abi will be a curated version designed to contain any method you find in any version.
